      Yesterday, Winamp, THE mp3 player, introduced skinnable user
      interfaces. Today all applications MUST be skinnable: your CD
      player, your email notifier, even your operating system! Now
      with Skin Look And Feel,YOUR Java™ application is skinnable!
      Skin Look And Feel is able to read GTK (The Gimp ToolKit) and
      KDE (The K Desktop Environment) Skins to enhance your
      application GUI controls such as Buttons, Checks, Radios,
      Scrollbars, Progress Bar, Lists, Tables, Internal Frames,
      Colors, Background Textures, Regular Windows.
