      <title>First Time Skin Look And Feel</title>
      <p>
        There are two different ways to use Skin Look And Feel: the
        classic LookAndFeel way and the Skinit way. In both cases, you
        need to know which skins or themepacks you are going to
        use. Let say we are going to use the default themepack which
        comes with SkinLF, it is named "themepack.zip" and is located
        in the "lib" directory of the SkinLF distribution.
      </p>

      <section>
        <title>Classic LookAndFeel way</title>
        <p>
          Enabling SkinLF in your application is more or less like
          enabling other look and feels, it is just telling SkinLF
          which themepacks to use and calling
          <i>UIManager.setLookAndFeel</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an example from the demo class:
<pre class="code">
        // first tell SkinLF which theme to use
        <a href="javadoc/com/l2fprod/gui/plaf/skin/Skin.html">Skin</a> theSkinToUse = <a href="javadoc/com/l2fprod/gui/plaf/skin/SkinLookAndFeel.html#loadThemePack(java.lang.String)">SkinLookAndFeel.loadThemePack("themepack.zip")</a>;
        <a href="javadoc/com/l2fprod/gui/plaf/skin/SkinLookAndFeel.html#setSkin(com.l2fprod.gui.plaf.skin.Skin)">SkinLookAndFeel.setSkin(theSkinToUse)</a>;

        // finally set the Skin Look And Feel
        UIManager.setLookAndFeel(new <a href="javadoc/com/l2fprod/gui/plaf/skin/SkinLookAndFeel.html">SkinLookAndFeel()</a>);
</pre>
        </p>
      </section>

        <title>Skinit</title>
        <p>
          Skinit is a small java class which ships with Skin Look And
          Feel and provides a non intrusive solution to skin any
          applications. You only need to know how to start from the
          command line the application you want to skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose you start your application with:
<pre class="code">
java -cp myapp.jar com.mypackage.MyApp arg1 arg2
</pre>
          then with SkinLF, it will look like:
<pre class="code">
java -cp skinlf.jar;myapp.jar Skinit -pack themepack.zip com.mypackage.MyApp arg1 arg2
</pre>
          That's it. Your application will start skinned with the
          themepack. This is the fastest way to get your app skinned.

          Folks at netbeans have skinned their IDE too using this
